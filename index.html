<h2>News</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Sung Min joined Aerospace Engineering at KAIST as of July 5, 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Who we are</h2>
<ul>
  <p>AAG is an interdisciplinary team to address challenges in the physical modeling of aerothermodynamics with uncertainty quantification. Research goal of AAG is to develop novel computational models and methods to discover unknown physics behind aerothermodynamic environments, such as planetary entry plasmas, high-temperature gas-surface interactions, and radiation-matter interactions. The systems of interest are composed of atoms, molecules, ions, and electrons surrounded by electromagnetic waves to understand the details of energy transfers among them in both micro- and macroscopic scales. Relevant applications typically address:</p>
    <ul> 
      <li>Hypersonic flows with uncertainty quantification</li>
      <li>Plasma-driven high-speed flow control</li>
      <li>Plasma-assisted combustion</li>
      <li>High-performance computing applications</li>
    </ul>
  <p>The research by AAG targets applications to a wide range of engineering problems in interdisciplinary, multi-scale, and multi-physics coupled environments. We are actively looking for highly motivated students and postdoc scholars who are interested in joining AAG! So please feel free to <a href = "mailto: smjo@kaist.ac.kr">contact us.</a></p>
