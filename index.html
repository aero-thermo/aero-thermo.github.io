<h2>Who we are</h2>
<ul>
  <p>AAG is an interdisciplinary team to address challenges in the physical modeling of aerothermodynamics and plasma dynamics in general. Research goal of AAG is to develop novel computational models and methods to discover unknown physics behind aerothermodynamic environment, such as planetary entry plasmas, high-temperature gas-surface interactions, and radiation-matter interactions. The systems of interest are composed of atoms, molecules, ions, and electrons surrounded by electromagnetic waves to understand the details of energy transfers among them in both micro- and macroscopic scales. Relevant applications typically address:</p>
